## Description

This is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. This uses Express.js for writing, MongoDB for the database, and the Mongoose ODM. The walk-thru video using Insonia to test the routes will be linked below.
